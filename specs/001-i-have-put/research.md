# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: AI Movie Platform Core with PayloadCMS and Chat Interface  
**Date**: 2025-01-25  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Summary

This document resolves technical unknowns and documents architectural decisions for the AI movie platform implementation.

## Technical Stack Decisions

### PayloadCMS 3.5+ Integration
**Decision**: Use PayloadCMS 3.56 as the central data management system  
**Rationale**: 
- Version 3.56 provides the latest collection patterns and API improvements
- Built-in authentication, file uploads, and admin interface
- Strong TypeScript support with automatic type generation
- Flexible collection configuration for complex relationships
**Alternatives considered**: 
- Custom Express.js backend (rejected: more complex, less features)
- Strapi (rejected: not in constitution requirements)
- Directus (rejected: not in constitution requirements)

### Real-Time Communication
**Decision**: WebSocket implementation using Next.js API routes with Socket.io  
**Rationale**:
- Required for real-time chat interface and progress updates
- Socket.io provides connection management and fallback mechanisms
- Integrates well with Next.js API routes
- Supports real-time collaboration features
**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-Sent Events (rejected: one-way communication)
- Polling (rejected: inefficient for real-time requirements)
- WebRTC (rejected: overkill for chat interface)

### File Upload Strategy
**Decision**: PayloadCMS upload functionality with Cloudflare R2 adapter  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement to use PayloadCMS data layer
- R2 provides cost-effective object storage
- Built-in media processing and resizing capabilities
- Automatic metadata tracking and relationship management
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct cloud storage (rejected: violates PayloadCMS supremacy)
- Local file storage (rejected: not scalable)

### AI Service Integration
**Decision**: API route middleware for AI processing services  
**Rationale**:
- Keeps AI service complexity separate from core chat interface
- Allows for multiple AI providers (text, image, video generation)
- Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Secure API key management through environment variables
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct client-side AI calls (rejected: security concerns)
- Embedded AI models (rejected: resource constraints)

### Component Architecture
**Decision**: Server-first with selective client components  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for server-first architecture
- Better performance and SEO optimization
- Reduced JavaScript bundle size
- Client components only for interactive features (chat input, WebSocket)
**Alternatives considered**:
- Full client-side React app (rejected: violates constitution)
- Pure server-side rendering (rejected: limits real-time features)

### Styling Strategy
**Decision**: Tailwind CSS 4+ with component-scoped utilities  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for Tailwind CSS 4+
- Consistent design system across chat interface
- Better tree-shaking and performance
- Responsive design capabilities for mobile chat interface
**Alternatives considered**:
- CSS Modules (rejected: not in constitution)
- Styled Components (rejected: not in constitution)
- Custom CSS (rejected: constitutional constraint)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Vitest + Playwright with TDD approach  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for test-driven development
- Vitest integrates well with modern TypeScript setup
- Playwright provides comprehensive E2E testing for chat flows
- Fast test execution for rapid development cycles
**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest (rejected: slower setup with newer TypeScript)
- Cypress (rejected: more complex than Playwright)

### Development Workflow
**Decision**: PayloadCMS local API pattern  
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement to use PayloadCMS data layer
- Type-safe database operations
- Built-in validation and hooks
- Consistent error handling patterns
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct database queries (rejected: violates constitution)
- Custom ORM layer (rejected: adds unnecessary complexity)

## Integration Patterns

### Chat Interface Flow
1. Server component renders initial chat state
2. Client component handles user input and WebSocket connection
3. API routes process messages and coordinate AI services
4. PayloadCMS manages conversation persistence
5. Real-time updates via WebSocket for collaborative features

### File Upload Flow
1. Client component handles drag-drop interface
2. PayloadCMS upload API processes files
3. Media collection stores metadata and relationships
4. AI services process uploaded references
5. Chat interface updates with processed results

### Progress Tracking Pattern
1. PayloadCMS session collection tracks workflow state
2. Server components display current progress
3. WebSocket updates notify of status changes
4. Client components update progress indicators
5. Persistent storage maintains session continuity

## Performance Considerations

### Chat Responsiveness
- WebSocket connection pooling for multiple users
- Message batching for high-frequency updates
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on errors
- Efficient re-rendering with React Server Components

### File Processing
- Chunked upload for large media files
- Background processing with status updates
- Automatic compression and optimization
- CDN distribution via Cloudflare R2

### AI Service Integration
- Request queuing for resource management
- Timeout handling with user feedback
- Fallback mechanisms for service unavailability
- Caching for frequently requested operations

## Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization
- PayloadCMS built-in authentication system
- Role-based access control (user, admin, producer)
- Session management with secure tokens
- API endpoint protection with middleware

### File Upload Security
- File type validation and sanitization
- Size limits and virus scanning
- Secure storage with access controls
- Media URL signing for protected content

### AI Service Security
- API key rotation and secure storage
- Request rate limiting and throttling
- Input sanitization for AI prompts
- Output validation and filtering

## Technical Unknowns Resolved

### FR-014 AI Capabilities Clarification
**Decision**: Support for text generation (LLM), image generation, and basic video processing  
**Implementation**: Modular AI service architecture supporting multiple providers

### FR-017 Embedding Requirements Clarification
**Decision**: Use Jina v4 multimodal embeddings for media search and similarity  
**Implementation**: Background embedding generation with PayloadCMS hooks
