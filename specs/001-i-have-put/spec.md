## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A content creator wants to produce an AI-generated animated series. They start by describing their movie concept through a conversational chat interface. The system guides them through a structured workflow covering story development, character creation, visual design, and production phases. Throughout the process, the user can upload reference materials, make choices from AI-suggested options, or manually override suggestions. The system tracks progress and maintains all project assets in an organized manner.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user account, **When** they create their first project, **Then** they can access a guided chat interface that walks them through the initial concept development
2. **Given** an active chat session, **When** the user uploads reference images, **Then** the system processes and stores these assets while incorporating them into AI-generated suggestions
3. **Given** the AI presents multiple choices, **When** the user selects an option, **Then** the system advances to the next workflow step and updates project progress
4. **Given** the user wants specific control, **When** they choose manual override, **Then** they can provide custom instructions that the system incorporates into the workflow
5. **Given** a project in progress, **When** the user returns to the chat interface, **Then** they can resume from their last workflow step with full conversation history preserved

### Edge Cases
- What happens when file uploads exceed size limits or unsupported formats?
- How does the system handle simultaneous access by multiple collaborators?
- What occurs when AI processing services are temporarily unavailable?
- How does the system manage projects that exceed user subscription limits?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide user authentication with role-based access (user, admin, producer)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to create and manage movie projects with metadata (title, genre, episode count, target audience)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a real-time chat interface for project interaction
- **FR-004**: System MUST guide users through structured movie production workflow phases (story development, character creation, visual design, audio design, scene production, post production, final assembly)
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow file uploads for reference materials (images, documents, audio, video)
- **FR-006**: System MUST present contextual multiple-choice options based on current workflow step
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow manual override of AI suggestions at any workflow step
- **FR-008**: System MUST track and persist conversation history for each project session
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain project progress tracking with completion percentages
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce subscription-based limits on project count and episode count
- **FR-011**: System MUST support project collaboration with multiple users
- **FR-012**: System MUST store and organize generated media assets with metadata
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide administrative interface for content management
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate with AI processing services for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific AI capabilities - text generation, image generation, video processing?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle real-time communication during chat sessions
- **FR-016**: System MUST validate user inputs and provide error handling
- **FR-017**: System MUST support media embedding and search capabilities [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific embedding requirements not detailed]
- **FR-018**: System MUST track AI-generated content with generation metadata (prompts, model versions, timestamps)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User**: Individual with authentication credentials, role assignment, subscription tier, project associations, and preferences
- **Project**: Movie production container with title, genre, settings, progress tracking, collaborator relationships, and associated media
- **Session**: Active chat session linked to user and project, maintaining conversation history, current workflow step, and context data
- **Media**: Digital assets (images, audio, video, documents) with type classification, generation metadata, project relationships, and embedding data
