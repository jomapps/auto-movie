# Feature Specification: Projects Interface Management

**Feature Branch**: `002-now-that-we`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Now that we have basic structure, I would like to wire up the interface, form, listing, editing and seleciton of Projects."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: For the project listing sorting and filtering capabilities (FR-010), what sorting criteria should be available to users? ‚Üí A: Full attributes (date, title, status, progress percentage, genre)
- Q: For project editing permissions (FR-011), who should be able to edit a project? ‚Üí A: All logged-in users (temporary)
- Q: When project data fails to load due to network issues (mentioned in edge cases), what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Show error message only, user must manually retry
- Q: For form validation error handling, what should happen when a user submits a form with validation errors? ‚Üí A: Block submission, show all errors at once inline
- Q: For the "visual feedback during project operations" requirement (FR-007), what specific loading states should be shown? ‚Üí A: Minimal feedback (success/error toast notifications only)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Content creators and movie producers need to manage their movie projects through a complete lifecycle - from initial creation to editing and selection. They need to create new projects with essential details, browse their existing projects, edit project information, and select projects to work on or view details.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the projects dashboard, **When** they click "New Project" button, **Then** a project creation form appears with all necessary fields
2. **Given** a user fills out the project creation form with valid data, **When** they submit the form, **Then** the project is created and appears in their project list
3. **Given** a user has existing projects, **When** they view the projects dashboard, **Then** all their projects are displayed in a grid with key information visible
4. **Given** a user clicks on a project card, **When** the selection occurs, **Then** they are navigated to the project details page
5. **Given** a user is viewing project details, **When** they click an edit button, **Then** an edit form appears with current project data pre-filled
6. **Given** a user modifies project information in the edit form, **When** they save changes, **Then** the project is updated and changes are reflected immediately
7. **Given** a user has multiple projects, **When** they apply sorting or filtering, **Then** the project list updates according to their selection criteria

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to create a project with missing required fields?
- How does the system handle extremely long project titles or descriptions?
- What occurs if a user tries to edit a project they don't have permission to modify?
- How does the system respond when no projects exist for a user?
- What happens if project data fails to load due to network issues? ‚Üí System displays error message and requires manual user retry

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a form interface for users to create new movie projects with title, description, genre, episode count, target audience, and other essential project metadata
- **FR-002**: System MUST display all user's projects in a visual grid layout showing project title, description, genre, status, progress, and timestamps
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click on any project to view its detailed information
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an edit interface where users can modify existing project information
- **FR-005**: System MUST save project changes immediately when users submit edits
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all project form inputs, block submission when invalid, and display all validation errors inline at once
- **FR-007**: System MUST show minimal visual feedback through success/error toast notifications during project operations
- **FR-008**: Users MUST be able to navigate between project listing, creation, editing, and detail views seamlessly
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle empty states gracefully when users have no projects
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide sorting and filtering capabilities for project lists by date (creation/update), title, status, progress percentage, and genre
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow all logged-in users to edit any project (temporary - full permission model to be implemented later)
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist all project data reliably and handle data loading failures gracefully

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents a movie/series project with attributes including title, description, genre, episode count, target audience, status, progress tracking, creation/modification timestamps, and associated user relationships
- **User**: Project creator and collaborator with permissions to create, view, edit, and manage projects
- **Project Form**: Interface entity containing validation rules, field definitions, and submission handling for project creation and editing
