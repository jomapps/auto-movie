# Quickstart: Projects Interface Management

## Overview
This quickstart guide validates the complete Projects Interface Management implementation through end-to-end user scenarios.

## Prerequisites
- Development server running (`pnpm run dev`)
- MongoDB connected via PayloadCMS
- At least one test user account available
- Projects collection configured in PayloadCMS

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Create New Project (Happy Path)
**Goal**: Verify users can create projects with complete form validation

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/projects`
2. Click "New Project" button
3. Fill out project creation form:
   - Title: "Test Movie Project" 
   - Description: "A test project for quickstart validation"
   - Genre: "Drama"
   - Episode Count: 12
   - Target Audience: "Family"
   - Quality Tier: "Standard"
4. Submit form
5. Verify redirect to project details page
6. Confirm project appears in projects list

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Form validates inputs correctly
- ✅ Project created with auto-generated ID
- ✅ User redirected to `/dashboard/projects/{projectId}`
- ✅ Project visible in list at `/dashboard/projects`
- ✅ createdBy field set to current user
- ✅ Initial progress values set correctly

### Scenario 2: Project Listing and Navigation
**Goal**: Verify project listing displays correctly with proper navigation

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/projects`
2. Verify project grid displays existing projects
3. Check project cards show:
   - Title and description
   - Genre and status badges  
   - Progress bar and percentage
   - Created/Updated timestamps
   - "View Details" and "Chat" buttons
4. Click "View Details" on a project
5. Verify navigation to project details page with correct URL

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All user's projects displayed in grid layout
- ✅ Project information correctly formatted
- ✅ Navigation links work properly
- ✅ Project URLs follow `/dashboard/projects/[id]` pattern
- ✅ Empty state shown when no projects exist

### Scenario 3: Project Details and Information Display
**Goal**: Verify project details page shows complete project information

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard/projects/{projectId}` directly
2. Verify page loads with project data
3. Check all project fields are displayed:
   - Basic info (title, description, genre)
   - Project settings (aspect ratio, duration, quality)
   - Progress information (phase, percentage)
   - Timestamps and creator info
4. Verify "Edit Project" button is available
5. Test navigation back to projects list

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Project data loads correctly from PayloadCMS
- ✅ All project fields displayed with proper formatting
- ✅ Edit button visible for project owner/collaborator
- ✅ Navigation breadcrumbs/links work correctly
- ✅ 404 page shown for non-existent projects

### Scenario 4: Project Editing (Happy Path)
**Goal**: Verify users can edit existing projects with validation

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to project details page
2. Click "Edit Project" button
3. Verify form loads with current project data pre-filled
4. Modify project information:
   - Change title to "Updated Test Project"
   - Update description
   - Change genre to "Comedy"
   - Modify episode count to 8
5. Submit form
6. Verify changes are saved and reflected immediately

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Edit form loads with existing data
- ✅ All fields editable and properly validated
- ✅ Changes saved to PayloadCMS successfully
- ✅ Updated data visible immediately after save
- ✅ updatedAt timestamp reflects changes

### Scenario 5: Form Validation and Error Handling
**Goal**: Verify comprehensive form validation works correctly

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to project creation form
2. Test required field validation:
   - Submit form with empty title (should fail)
   - Submit form with invalid genre (should fail)
3. Test field constraints:
   - Enter title over 200 characters (should fail)
   - Enter episode count over 50 (should fail)
   - Enter negative episode count (should fail)
4. Test valid data submission works
5. Test network error handling (disconnect network, submit form)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Required field errors displayed clearly
- ✅ Field constraint validation works
- ✅ Error messages are user-friendly
- ✅ Form prevents submission with invalid data
- ✅ Network errors handled gracefully
- ✅ Validation consistent between client and server

### Scenario 6: Access Control and Permissions
**Goal**: Verify project access controls work correctly

**Steps**:
1. Create project with User A
2. Log in as User B (different user)
3. Verify User B cannot see User A's project in list
4. Try to access User A's project URL directly
5. Add User B as collaborator via admin panel
6. Verify User B can now access and edit the project

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Users only see projects they own or collaborate on
- ✅ Direct URL access properly protected
- ✅ 403 Forbidden shown for unauthorized access
- ✅ Collaborators can access shared projects
- ✅ PayloadCMS access controls enforced

### Scenario 7: Filtering and Sorting
**Goal**: Verify project list filtering and sorting functionality

**Steps**:
1. Create multiple test projects with different:
   - Genres (Action, Comedy, Drama)
   - Statuses (Concept, Production, Completed)
   - Creation dates
2. Navigate to projects list
3. Test genre filtering - select "Action" filter
4. Test status filtering - select "Production" filter
5. Test sorting - sort by creation date, title, progress
6. Test combined filters and sorting

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Filters correctly limit displayed projects
- ✅ Sorting changes project order appropriately
- ✅ Filter state persisted in URL parameters
- ✅ Clear filters option available
- ✅ Multiple filters can be combined

## Performance Validation

### Load Time Expectations
- Project list page: < 500ms initial load
- Project details page: < 300ms load
- Form submissions: < 1s response time
- Client-side sorting: < 100ms response

### Accessibility Validation  
- All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- Form fields have proper labels and ARIA attributes
- Error messages announced by screen readers
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines

## Cleanup
After quickstart completion:
1. Delete test projects created during validation
2. Remove any test user accounts if created
3. Reset any modified project data

## Success Criteria
✅ All 7 scenarios pass without errors
✅ Performance targets met
✅ Accessibility requirements satisfied  
✅ No console errors during testing
✅ PayloadCMS data integrity maintained

This quickstart provides comprehensive validation that the Projects Interface Management feature works correctly end-to-end.
