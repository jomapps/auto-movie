# Research Findings: Projects Interface Management

## Clarifications Applied (Session 2025-09-26)
Based on clarification session, key requirements have been specified:
- **Sorting/Filtering**: Full attribute sorting by date, title, status, progress percentage, and genre
- **Permissions**: Temporary open access for all logged-in users
- **Form Validation**: Block submission with all inline errors displayed simultaneously
- **Visual Feedback**: Minimal toast notifications only (no loading spinners)
- **Error Handling**: Manual retry required for network failures

## Research Questions Resolved

### 1. Next.js App Router Patterns for Project-Centric URLs

**Decision**: Use dynamic route structure `/dashboard/projects/[projectId]/...` with searchParams for project context

**Rationale**: 
- Enables seamless project navigation and deep linking
- searchParams allow project information to be available across all project-related pages
- Follows Next.js App Router conventions for dynamic segments
- Supports both client and server-side project context access

**Alternatives considered**:
- Context providers for project state (complex state management)
- Query parameters only (less SEO-friendly, harder to bookmark)
- Session-based project selection (not shareable, poor UX)

### 2. Form Management Best Practices for PayloadCMS Integration

**Decision**: Use React Hook Form with Zod validation, server actions for mutations

**Rationale**:
- Integrates well with PayloadCMS field validation
- Type-safe form handling with minimal boilerplate
- Server actions provide progressive enhancement
- Supports both optimistic updates and proper error handling

**Alternatives considered**:
- Formik (heavier bundle, less TypeScript integration)
- Native form handling (more boilerplate, less validation)
- SWR mutations only (client-side only, no progressive enhancement)

### 3. Project Listing and Filtering Patterns

**Decision**: Server-side rendering with URL-based filtering, client-side interactions for sorting

**Rationale**:
- Initial page load is fast with SSR
- Filtering state persists in URL (shareable, bookmarkable)
- Client-side sorting provides immediate feedback
- Follows server-first architecture principles

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full client-side data fetching (slower initial load)
- No URL persistence (poor UX for filtering state)
- Server-side sorting only (slower interactions)

### 4. Real-time Updates and Optimistic UI

**Decision**: Optimistic updates for immediate feedback, revalidation for data consistency

**Rationale**:
- Provides instant user feedback for better UX
- Next.js revalidation ensures data consistency
- Handles offline scenarios gracefully
- Balances performance with reliability

**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSocket real-time updates (unnecessary complexity for this feature)
- No optimistic updates (slower perceived performance)
- Client-side state only (data inconsistency risks)

### 5. Permission Model and Access Control

**Decision**: Creator-owner model with collaborative editing support via PayloadCMS access controls

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing PayloadCMS permission system
- Clear ownership model (creator is owner)
- Flexible collaboration through collaborators field
- Consistent with PayloadCMS security patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Role-based permissions (too complex for project scope)
- Public/private only (insufficient granularity)
- Custom permission middleware (reinventing PayloadCMS features)

### 6. Error Handling and Loading States (CLARIFIED)

**Decision**: Minimal error handling with manual retry, toast notifications only

**Rationale**:
- Simple, predictable error recovery mechanism
- Toast notifications provide sufficient user feedback
- Manual retry gives users control over error recovery
- Aligns with simplified UI feedback requirements

**Implementation Details (from clarification)**:
- Network failures: Show error message, require manual user retry
- Form validation: Block submission, display all errors inline simultaneously
- Visual feedback: Success/error toast notifications only (no loading spinners)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Auto-retry mechanisms (too complex for current requirements)
- Loading spinners and skeleton states (unnecessary complexity)
- Generic error pages (poor UX, less context)

## Technical Implementation Patterns

### Routing Structure
```
/dashboard/projects                    # Project listing
/dashboard/projects/new               # Create new project
/dashboard/projects/[id]              # Project details
/dashboard/projects/[id]/edit         # Edit project
/dashboard/projects/[id]/chat         # Project chat (existing)
/dashboard/projects/[id]/production   # Project production (future)
```

### Data Fetching Strategy
- Server components for initial data loading
- Client components only for interactive forms and real-time features
- PayloadCMS Local API for all data operations
- Revalidation tags for cache management

### Form Validation Integration
- Zod schemas mirror PayloadCMS field validation
- Client-side validation for immediate feedback
- Server-side validation as final gate
- Error message consistency between client and server

### State Management Approach
- URL-based state for filtering and pagination
- React Hook Form for form state
- Next.js cache for server state
- Minimal client-side state management

## Architecture Decisions Summary

1. **Project-centric routing** with dynamic segments and searchParams
2. **Server-first architecture** with selective client interactivity
3. **PayloadCMS-integrated forms** with proper validation
4. **Optimistic UI patterns** for better perceived performance
5. **Creator-collaborator permission model** using PayloadCMS access controls
6. **Consistent error handling** with fallback UI and loading states

All research findings support a cohesive, performant, and user-friendly project management interface that leverages existing PayloadCMS infrastructure while providing modern React application patterns.
